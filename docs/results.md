# Results and Conclusion

## Key Findings

1. **Project Duration**: The total project duration is 43 days.

2. **Critical Path**: 
   - The critical path follows: A → B → F → G → H → I → J → V
   - This path determines the minimum project duration
   - Any delay in these activities will delay the entire project

3. **Parallel Paths**:
   - Several activities can be performed in parallel
   - Non-critical activities have float time available
   - Resources can be optimized by utilizing float time effectively

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Critical Activities**:
   - Prioritize resources for activities on the critical path
   - Closely monitor progress of critical activities
   - Implement risk mitigation strategies for critical activities

2. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Utilize float time in non-critical activities
   - Balance resources between critical and non-critical paths
   - Consider resource leveling where appropriate

3. **Monitoring and Control**:
   - Regular progress updates for critical path activities
   - Track actual vs planned duration
   - Early identification of potential delays
