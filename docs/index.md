# Critical Path Method (CPM) Analysis

This documentation presents a detailed analysis of a project network using the Critical Path Method (CPM). The analysis includes:

- Detailed task breakdown
- Network diagram construction
- Forward and backward pass calculations
- Critical path identification
- Total project duration calculation

## Project Overview

This project consists of 22 activities (A through V) with various dependencies and durations. The goal is to determine the optimal project schedule and identify the critical path that determines the overall project duration.

## Key Findings

- Total Project Duration: 43 days
- Critical Path: A → B → F → G → H → I → J → V
- Number of Activities: 22
- Number of Independent Start Points: 3 (Activities A, K, and T)
